# A Beginner's Practical Guide to Vector Database: ChromaDB

## Introduction to ChromaDB

ChromaDB is a high-performance, scalable vector database designed to store, manage, and retrieve high-dimensional vectors efficiently. It is especially useful in applications involving machine learning, data science, and any field that requires fast and accurate similarity searches.

## Key Features

* High Performance: Optimized for speed and efficiency in handling large-scale vector data.
* Scalability: Easily scales to handle growing datasets and increasing query loads.
* Versatility: Supports various types of vector data and query methods.
* Integration: Compatible with popular machine learning frameworks and data processing libraries.

## Installing chromadb & dependicies

```sh
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev
pip install pdbwhereami
pip install chromadb
```

## Basic Concepts

##### Vectors

Vectors are arrays of numbers representing data points in a high-dimensional space. ChromaDB specializes in managing these vectors and performing operations such as similarity searches.

##### Collections

Collections are groups of vectors stored together in ChromaDB. They help organize and manage the data efficiently.

##### Indexes

Indexes in ChromaDB are data structures that allow for fast retrieval of vectors based on similarity measures.

### Getting Started & Sample programs

1. Initializing ChromaDB

   * Creating DB
2. Creating a Collection

   * Creating new collection
   * Creating existing collection
   * Get non-existing collection
   * Get existing collection
   * Get or create existing collection
   * Get or create new collection
   * Persistant collection - Save to disk
   * Loading Persistant collection - from disk
3. Adding Vectors to the Collection
4. Performing a Similarity Search

### Advanced Usage

* Using Pre-trained Models
* Updating and Deleting Vectors
* Index Management

### Best Practices

Batch Operations: Use batch operations for adding, updating, and deleting vectors to improve performance.
Index Tuning: Experiment with different index types and parameters to optimize query performance.
Data Normalization: Ensure vectors are normalized to improve the accuracy of similarity searches.

### Sample Programs

* Example 1: Basic CRUD Operations
* Example 2: Using Pre-trained Models
